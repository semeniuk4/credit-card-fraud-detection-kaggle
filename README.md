## Credit card fraud detection

In this project, we tackle the issue of credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, where fraudulent transactions make up a very small portion of the data, traditional models can struggle to effectively detect fraud. To address this, we apply `ADASYN` (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling) to resample the dataset, generating synthetic samples of the minority class.
